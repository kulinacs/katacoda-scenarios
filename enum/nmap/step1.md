When you enter the command line, your shell starts inside a directory. The directory you are in at any moment is called your `current working directory`. To view this directory. run `pwd`{{execute}}

Now, to see what files are in your current working directory, run `ls`{{execute}}

Finally, to change directories, you run `cd <filename>`. To demonstrate this, change to the root directory by running `cd /`{{execute}}
